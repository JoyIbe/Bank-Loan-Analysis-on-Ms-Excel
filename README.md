# Bank-Loan-Analysis-on-Ms-Excel

## Project Overview:
The objective of this analysis lies in providing precise insights into our bank‚Äôs lending operations and monitor loan performance. The dashboard aims at providing well-thought out information from metrics to access vital day-to-day operations which would enable us make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio. 

## Data Cleaning and Data Processing: 
Here, I took several steps to prepare the raw data for analysis, they include:
‚Ä¢Removing duplicated entries 
‚Ä¢Filtered out spelling errors and corrected them, assigned appropriate datatypes , special characters were substituted to be in an exact format. 
‚Ä¢A new column was added from ‚ÄúLoan status‚Äù to determine good vs bad loans. 

## üîë Key Performance indicators:
For this analysis, I have created two well defined dashboard, a summary and overview dashboard respectively. The following KPI requirements visualized includes:

- Summary Dashboard:
  
Primary KPIs:
‚Ä¢Total Loan Application
‚Ä¢Total Funded Amount
‚Ä¢Total Amount Received
‚Ä¢Average Interest Rate 
‚Ä¢Average Debt-to-Income Rate
Note: I tracked and recorded Month-to-Date (MTD)and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes across the aforementioned metrics. 

Secondary KPIs:
I created a grid view report categorized by ‚ÄúLoan Status‚Äù revealing good loan vs bad loan (Good loan refers to fully paid loan, otherwise means bad loan), showcasing loan application percentage, loan application, total funded amount, etc for both good and bad loan. 

- Overview Dashboard:
I visualized the following:
‚Ä¢Monthly Trends by issue date
‚Ä¢Regional Analysis by state
‚Ä¢Loan Term Analysis
‚Ä¢Employee Length Analysis 
‚Ä¢Loan Purpose Breakdown 
‚Ä¢Home Ownership Analysis

## üìäChart Description:
For adequate and comprehensible representation, I utilized the following for my analysis: 
‚Ä¢Filled Map: used this to show areas with concentrated lending operations and evaluate the differences between regions.
‚Ä¢Bar Charts: this illustrated how lending statistics are spread across borrowers by employment length and enabled us to evaluate the relationship between employment history and also showcasing the purpose of the loan.
‚Ä¢Line Chart: The chart showed periodic trends and long-term tendencies in the credit operations. 
‚Ä¢Tree map Chart: The chart showed a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan application. 
In conclusion, this analytic dashboard extensively explored necessary information about the bank‚Äôs credit history and operations revealing that the bank draws increased benefit from good loans. However, it has to function more optimally to minimize the number of bad loans.

## üìÇ Data Info: The raw data contained 24 columns, which turned 25 after processing and over 38.5k rows.
